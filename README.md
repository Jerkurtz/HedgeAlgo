# HedgeAlgo

## Purpose of this document is to outline the project of "HedgeAlgo" to the public eye. 

## Documentation of this project will be written in simple terms for anyone who is reading, so they are able to read it and understand it in its entirety withot utilizing a dictionary for every sentence.

### HedgeAlgo will be a basic compilation of PostgreSQL (Database), Alpaca API (A sort of bridge between your trading system and the stock market that is FREE) and simple yet targeted python (script or program) to run a micro Hedge Fund portfolio algorithm with paper money (paper money is fake imaginary money used to test or "Backtest" stock trading perforamance metrics).
### The performance of the micro hedge will be graphically mapped everyday to keep a easy to read visual of performance as well as a .md file (HA_Performance.md) to track the quantitative data output each day. 
### python portion of the project will be written in visual studio code for error check and to keep a backup of the project when something does not go as planned.
