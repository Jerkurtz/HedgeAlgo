# HedgeAlgo

## Purpose of this document is to outline the project of "HedgeAlgo" to the public eye. 
### HedgeAlgo will be a basic compilation of Postgresql DB, Alpaca API and simple yet targeted python to run a micro Hedge Fund portfolio algorithm with paper money.
### The performance of the micro hedge will be graphically mapped everyday to keep a easy to read visual of performance as well as a .md file (HA_Performance.md) to track the quantitative data output each day.
