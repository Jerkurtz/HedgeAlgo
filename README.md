# HedgeAlgo

## Purpose of this document is to outline the project of "HedgeAlgo" to the public eye. 

## Documentation of this project will be written in simple terms for anyone who is reading, so they are able to read it and understand it in its entirety withot utilizing a dictionary for every sentence.

### HedgeAlgo will be a basic compilation of Postgresql, Alpaca API and simple yet targeted python to run a micro Hedge Fund portfolio algorithm with paper money.
### The performance of the micro hedge will be graphically mapped everyday to keep a easy to read visual of performance as well as a .md file (HA_Performance.md) to track the quantitative data output each day. 
### python portion of the project will be written in visual studio code for error check and to keep a backup of the project when something does not go as planned.
